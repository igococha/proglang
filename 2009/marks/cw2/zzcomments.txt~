Comments:
- No javacc code for Repeat. I found a partial implementation for Repeat. The pretty printer does not compile - the code would print the statement with the incorrect indentations.
- Incomplete

Comments:
- Check the case with blocks inside Try. The "}" of the block does not come out nicely. But this is because of the "incorrect" specification I gave.

Comments:
- RepeatUntil(s,e): "repeat" and "until" are not aligned in final output when s is not a block.
- RepeatUntil(s,e): Extra space before "{" if s is a block. 
- Wrong indentations for Try, Catch and Finally: The amount of space added should be the same space subtracted. It causes the program to crash when more then one Catch is used -> indent goes to zero!!!
- Good use of data structures.
- Test file: Test for RepeatUnitil is not conclusive. No tests for Try/Throw.

Comments:
- RepeatUntil: Incorrect indentation for compound statements inside repeat's body. The variable indent has to be updated in order for the recursive printing of statments to work.
- Try/Catch: Same problem as with Repeat.
- Space missing after throw.
- Test: Complex statements inside Repeat/Throw/Catch not included.

Comment:  
- I'll assume that you did mean to write RepeatUntil in a single-line when the body is a single statement (not a block). However, this is not a good idea because the body may include other complex statements (while,ifThen,...) that do break-up their substatements and need the indentation variable do be updated correctly i.e. indent = indent + .... This was not tested.
- Problem when repeat is included inside a block.
- TryCatch: Good idea using Blocks.
- Test: Complex tests for repeat not included.

Comments:
- Main does not call pretty-printer and, therefore, does nothing. I added a call to PrettyPrintVisitor, which is the one you modified (see, for example, while-statement).
- Repeat: Does not create correct indentation and line-breaks.
- Try: Correct parsing and AST. Incorrect pretty-printing: no indentation or line-breaks.
- Throw: At least make sure there's an space after "throw".
- I couldn't find your testfile.

Comment:
- Repeat: No line-breaks used (or placed incorrectly) when printing repeat (see while statement).
- Try/Catch correctly parsed. Pretty-Printer is a mess.
- Throw does not need parenthesis around the expression (and should be printed "throw")
- Test file: No tests for complex structures inside repeat.

 Comment:
- Your code looks like Jelenski's coursewrok. Why?
- Repeat: No line-breaks used (or placed incorrectly) when printing repeat (see while statement for a coreect implementation).
- Try/Catch correctly parsed. Pretty-Printer does not work as it should.
- Throw does not need parenthesis around the expression (and should be printed "throw")
- Test file: No tests for complex structures inside repeat.

Comment:
- I couldn't find your test file.
- Minijava.jj errors: () missing after Statement inside Repeat. Colon missing after TryStatement definition.
- I couldn't compile the program due to the references to TypeVisitor and ExclusiveOr.
Now, your program didn't compile...how did you test it?
After the fixes:
- RepeatUntil: Incorrect indentation.
- Wrong syntax for catch. Sequences of catches should not be between {}.
- Indentation is not updated when printing. Sequence of catches (CatchBlock) is not printed.
- Throw is printed without indentation. Semicolon missing.

Comments:
- Repeat: Correct parsing and AST. Wrong indentation and line-breaks for pretty-printer.
- TryCatch. Note that Catch is not a statement , it is part of Try. Try and Finally only contains a single statement inside their bodies and do not require a statement list, unless you decide to use *. Same with the body of Catch.
- Syntax: use "catch" instead of "catch ".
- TryCatch: The pretty-printer does not use the correct indentations and line-breaks. It completely breaks 
- Throw is a separate statement. Your syntax is wrong. It should be throw <Exp>, as indicated by the specification.
- Test incomplete. No tests for complex statements inside bodies of repeat, try, etc. Eg include and if statement inside the repeat.

Comments:
- Repeat should create a new line for the body and update 'indent' depending on the type of body (block or not), and, similarly, create a new line for until (see while statement implementation). It is supossed to be a pretty-printer!
- Still, you make the same mistakes with the pretty-printer and do not update indent accordingly.
- Try is a statement that contains catch and finally sub-parts. Catch and Finally are NOT separate statements.
- The type part of catch is not printed.
- Throw expression need not be in parenthesis.
- Your tests do not include separate cases when the body of a repeat/try/etc is a block or not.

Comments:  -- program does not compiler ---
- Compilation error with Repeat visitor. Fixed.
- Repeat print: new line missing.
- Try/Catch: The minijava part is not working (no catch, wrong declarations), and does not match the constructor for Try. Fixed.
- Compilation error with Try and catch visitor. Fixed.
....can't continue fixing bad code.
- Throw is not an expression (tha part has been removed). The throw statement should be defined as "throw" <Exp> - this does not match your syntax.
- Throw: Wrong use of constructor inside mnijava.jj.
- Tests incomplete. Some do not meet.

Comments:
- Repeat pretty-print: You must update the indent variable and print the body and until parts in a separate line, following the implementation of the while pretty-print. Otherwise, mixing repeat and other complex statements will create bad otput (it's already not great).
- Try/Catch: Good, though the statements inside the bodies should be moved a couple of spaces to the right.
- Test repeat with complex statements inside its body. More than one catch as well.

Comments:
- Try/Catch: The code asks if the body of the catch (throw/finally) is a block or not, and increments indent accordingly. Later indent is updated regardless of the type of body. The presence of several blocks will cause indent to reach zero and negative numbers thus producing wrong indentations and eventually and exception. 
Besides that, it's perfect.

Comments:
- Incorrect syntax for Repeat: "until" must be followed by (<EXP>). However, since (<EXP>) is also an expression, it works when parenthesis are used. Unfortunately it also accepts things like repeat..until x, which does not follow the syntax.
- Repeat pretty-print: Extra line break.
- Try/Catch: Pretty-print of multiple catches is wrong. No test included.
- Try/Catch: catch and finally should be aligned with try.
- Try/Catch: Indentation is not set back to initial value.
- Throw does not contain parenthesis.

Comments:
- It would've been better to create a new line before statarting the body block inside the repeat to avoid getting that extra space after "repeat". This actually becomes a problem when indent has a bigger value, causing greater gaps as a result.
- Test more complex expressions inside repeat,try,etc, or include repeat,try, etc at different depths.

Comments:
- Minijava.jj: TryStatement, ThrowStatement, CatchStatement undefined.
- Compilation errors:
* Or and RepeatUntil not included in visitor/Visitor.java
* Repeat or RepeatUntil??
* Or.java: v.Visit - upper-case!
* visit(RepeatUnil) : extra quote after until.
After fixing everything - I guess this never ran correctly:
- Incorrect syntax for repeat/until. Should be: 
  repeat s until(e)
- Test: Useless, didn't include any of the new statements.

Comments:
- Repeat must create a new line for the body and until. Otherwhise, printing coplex statements included inside a body of a repeat will get bad indentations - it already creates unneccessary space after repea and until. For example:
repeat if (e) s1 else s2.
You must test theses cases.
- Similar problem with Try/Catch. Do you want to "{" and "}" in the syntax? Decide (jj).
- Why print indentation after "catch"? Indentation should be used to measure the distance from the left margin to the beginning of the text.
- Forgot semi-colon when printing throw.
