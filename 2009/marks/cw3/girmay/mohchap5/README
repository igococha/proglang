MiniJava parser, abstract syntax tree builder, 
symbol table builder and typechecker

The file minijava.jj contains the lexical and syntactic definition
of MiniJava along with action code that builds abstract syntax trees.

Directory syntaxtree contains the syntax tree classes.
Directory visitor contains the visitor classes, a pretty-print visitor,
a symbol table definition and a symbol table builder visitor, and 
typechecker visitors.

The class Main in file Main.java drives it all.

Compile with:

module add java soi javacc/3.2
javacc minijava.jj
javac Main.java

and run with:

java Main filename

where filename is a file containing a MiniJava program
(eg one of those examples from the minijava/programs directory)

The output is a pretty-printed version of the input program,
and any error messages produced from the typechecking.
