David,

general: no breakdown of marks in marking scheme
         School style now calls for new page for each question

1(a): What sort of explanation is required?
      (question seems to ask why procedure calls etc need stack frames)
      "old SP becomes current frame pointer FP" repeated
      is it OK to have an implementation without FP?

1(d): can "value too big, an array" be relevant for a value in a reg?

Ross
