Subject: comments on Language Processors paper

1(a) no model answer
1(b) The description seems to correspond to
	[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?(E[-+]?[0-9]+)?
How many marks for the bare correct answer?  How do they make it readable?
1(c) In the model answer, "_" should be "_?"
1(d) question: "where" could be ambiguous: "in which type environment"?
     model answer: allocation of marks to parts?  line 6: sigma_3

2(b) "program fragment"?  Should this be expression/input fragment?
2(c) Specify associativity?
2(d) Model answers have different associativity for TIMES. NO!!!! ROss wrong
	Part marks if they don't use wrapper classes?

3 "between exp1 and exp2" doesn't specify the order:
	"from the value of exp1 to that of exp2"?  (value pedantry optional)
     "upper and lower" should be "lower and upper"?
3(d) allocation of part marks in answer?
3(e) "asbtract"
     "representation" -> "code"?
     in the answer, the moving between R1 and MEM(i) doesn't look right.
     Also I couldn't work out the 5th line.

4(b,c) part marks in model answer?
