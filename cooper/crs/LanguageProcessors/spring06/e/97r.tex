\subquestion

Give a definition for regular expressions which shows how
arbitrary regular expressions can be constructed for a
given alphabet (set) of symbols. Do not include shorthand
notations you may know.
\marks{15}

\subquestion
        In some editors, pattern matching notation is
        provided as detailed in the table below.
        For example, the expression \verb"{.*}" 
        matches any sequence of characters with enclosing
        curly brackets.
        Show how the patterns in the table can be represented by regular
        expressions. Show also that regular expression notation is
        more powerful than the editor pattern notation by
        finding examples of patterns that can be expressed in the
        regular expression notation but not in the editor pattern
        notation.

\subquestion

What is an ambiguous grammar? By giving suitable examples show that the
        following grammar is ambiguous. 
\begin{tabbing}
stmtxxx\=$\rightarrow$xxx\=if\kill
\it
stmt \> $\rightarrow$ \> \verb"if" {\it expr\/} \verb"then" {\it stmt} \\
\it
     \> $\mid$ \> \verb"if" {\it expr\/} \verb"then" {\it stmt\/} \verb"else" {\it stmt} \\
     \> $\mid$ \> {\it other}
\end{tabbing}
Here {\it other\/} stands for any other statement.
\marks{20}
\begin{modelanswer}
Two parse trees for \verb"if b1 then if b2 then s1 else s"
\end{modelanswer}

\subquestion Rewrite the \verb"if"-\verb"then"-\verb"else" grammar in the
previous subquestion to remove the ambiguity, arranging your productions
so that the grammar matches each \verb"else" with the closest previous
unmatched \verb"then".
For example, in a parse tree for the statement:
\begin{verbatim}
if b1 then if b2 then s1 else s2
\end{verbatim}
the \verb"else" part should be associated with the 
second \verb"if"-\verb"then".

\question

\begin{subquestions}

\subquestion
The following is an extract from a possible BNF syntax for
an imperative programming language: 
\begin{bnf}
\Rule{\nt{Compound\ }}{\nt{Instruction} \verb";" \nt{Compound}\Or{\nt{Instruction}}} \\
\Rule{\nt{Instruction\ }}{\nt{Cond}\Or{\ldots}} \\
\Rule{\nt{Cond}}{\verb"if" \nt{BoolExp} \verb"then" \nt{Compound$_1$} \verb"else" \nt{Compound$_2$} \verb"end"}\\
\Rule{\nt{IntExp}}{\nt{IntVar}\Or{\nt{IntConstant}}\Or{\nt{IntExp} \verb"+" \nt{IntExp}}
        \Or{\nt{IntExp} \verb"*" \nt{IntExp}}}\\
\Rule{\nt{BoolExp}}{\nt{IntExp} \verb"=" \nt{IntExp}\Or{\nt{IntExp} \verb"<=" \nt{IntExp}}}
\end{bnf}
where \nt{IntVar} is a variable of type INTEGER, \nt{IntConstant}
is an INTEGER type constant (eg 3).

The meaning of a \nt{Cond} is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item On entry to the instruction, the \nt{BoolExp} is 
        evaluated. 
\item If the value of the \nt{BoolExp} is true, the effect of
        the \nt{Cond} is the effect of \nt{Compound$_1$}.
\item Otherwise, when the \nt{BoolExp} evaluates to false,
        the effect of the \nt{Cond} is the effect of
        of \nt{Compound$_2$}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubquestion
        Outline the structure of the
        code that might be generated in translation of
        a \nt{Cond} with an example 
        \nt{BoolExp} (\verb"a+1 <= b*2", say).

        stack machine, and briefly explain the
        instructions you use in your outline.

\subsubquestion
        Construct a syntax-directed translation for 
        \nt{Cond} and \nt{BoolExp} which produces such code.
        Describe any attributes you
        introduce, and make clear any assumptions you make about 
        the attributes and code generated for the
        expressions \nt{IntExp}, but you need not produce translations for
        \nt{IntExp}.

\question

\begin{subquestions}

\subquestion

Using examples describe the structure and function of the
code that must be produced by a code generator to manage a run-time
stack at the time of procedure call and return.
\marks{30}
\begin{modelanswer}
Call:
\begin{enumerate}
%\setlength{\parsep}{0in}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}
\item caller code evaluates and stores actuals
\item caller code stores return address 
\item caller code stores its SP 
\item caller code increments the SP to callee rec
\item caller code jumps to the callee code
\item callee saves other required values (eg regs)
\item callee initialises local variables and begins execution 
\end{enumerate}
Return:
\begin{enumerate}
%\setlength{\parsep}{0in}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}
\item callee code stores any return value
\item callee code restores required values (eg regs)
\item callee code copies control link (callers SP) into SP
\item callee branches to the stored return address
\item caller code copies the return value 
\end{enumerate}
\end{modelanswer}

\subquestion
%Briefly describe the function of each
%of the subdivisions (areas), and
Discuss the programming language features which influence
the organisation and functioning of run time storage,
clearly associating any storage structures you
mention with the implementation of particular language features.
Choose a language you know well and briefly describe
its run time storage requirements and functioning.
%Explain why a typical C language memory model does not
%have an area set aside for dynamically allocated
%storage.
\marks{40}
\begin{modelanswer}
Language features: procedure call and parameter passing,
lexical scoping, dynamic storage allocation and deallocation,
including object creation. Name stack, heap, why different.
More marks for example languages
(eg Eiffel object creation, Pascal `new' etc). Operation of
stack and heap (with mention of garbage collection).
Particular language example gets more marks.
\end{modelanswer}


\subquestion
Explain what is 
meant by {\em fragmentation}, and mention some methods
for reducing fragmention in heaps.  
{\em Garbage\/} and {\em dangling pointers}
can occur in the implementation of programming languages which
support explicit deallocation of heap objects. Define
these terms and explain using simple example program
fragments how they arise.
Sketch the simple mark-sweep garbage collection algorithm
for automatic deallocation of inaccessible heap objects.

\question

\begin{subquestions}

\subquestion

Comment on how local variables,
parameters (arguments) and non-local variables
are addressed by the code generated for a
procedure when a run-time stack is in use,
and explain the need for a register `spill' area
in some records.
\marks{25}


\subquestion

Explain what is meant by the argument passing mechanisms usually
        known as
                \begin{enumerate}
                \item call-by-value
                \item call-by-reference
                \item call-by-value-result
                \item call-by-name
                \end{enumerate}
        Deduce for each mechanism what is the effect of
        the following procedure:
\begin{verbatim}
       PROCEDURE pass (p,q,r: INTEGER);
       BEGIN
            q := q + 1;
            r := r + p
       END pass;
\end{verbatim}   
        when the sequence of assignments and a procedure call
        shown below is executed, assuming that all arguments are
        passed with the same mechanism, and that \verb"a" and
        \verb"b" are variables of type INTEGER.
        Write down what is printed in each case by the \verb"WriteInt"
        call, and clearly justify your answer by reference to your
        description of the argument passing mechanism.
\begin{verbatim}
       a := 2;
       b := 3;
       pass (a+b,a,a);
       InOut.WriteInt (a)
\end{verbatim}
Although the program is written in a Modula-2-like syntax, 
the Modula-2 parameter-passing semantics do not apply and you must
instead consider each of the mechanisms mentioned.
