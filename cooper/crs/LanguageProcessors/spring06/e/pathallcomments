Just received this from Pat Hall (who, incidently, says he wishes to stand
down from the post of external examiner, due to other commitments):

hope all is well with you and yours.

P211: Language Processors I
1.  The questions seem very mechanical without graded parts for weaker and
stronger students.
2.  Question 1 (a) seems very odd and unclear, and really should be
replaced.  The claimed difference between the editor pattern and a regular
expression seems to hinge on what a "character" is.  This really is not the
basis for a question.  Why not just ask about regular expressions for an
easy first part for all students to score on.
3. Q1  (c) - I assume that "Tiger" is a programming language with which the
students are familiar.
4.  Question 2 (a) answer does not adequately distinguish between terminals
and non-terminals - would you accept this sort of confusion from a student?
5.  Some of the sample answers are just too vague for me to make any
reasonable assessment - for example Question 3.
