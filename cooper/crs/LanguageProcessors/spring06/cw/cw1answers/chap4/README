MiniJava parser and abstract syntax tree builder

The file minijava.jj contains the lexical and syntactic definition
of MiniJava along with action code that builds abstract syntax trees.

Directory syntaxtree contains the syntax tree classes.
Directory visitor contains the visitor class and a pretty-print visitor.

The class Main in file Main.java drives it all.

Compile with:

module add java soi javacc/3.2
javacc minijava.jj
javac Main.java

and run with:

java Main filename

where filename is a file containing a MiniJava program
(eg one of those examples from the minijava/programs directory)

The output is a pretty-printed version of the input program.
