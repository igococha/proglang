The MiniJava visitor class, and a visitor PrettyPrintVisitor that
simply traverses the abstract syntax tree and pretty-prints the
program (ie prints it out in a standard indented form).

I have written a better visitor (DBPrettyVisitor) that deals with
nested statements (the supplied PrettyPrintVisitor doesn't).
