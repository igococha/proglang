This is the first JavaCC lab example (for reg exps).
The reg exps and the driver class LexTest (which contains the main() method) are
all in LexTest.jj.

Run JavaCC on it with

    module add java soi javacc/3.2
    javacc LexTest.jj

Compile the resulting lexical analyser classes with
    
    javac *.java

Run the lexical analyser with

    java LexTest
